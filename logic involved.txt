This device works on the basic principle of depression in freezing point 
When an impurity is introduced in a pure substance. Its freezing point decreases.

Purity test 

The temperature of the pure petrol is 20 degree celcius but when an impurity is mixed into it(e.g-kerosene) Its temperature dereases below 20.
